BOOKMARKET

=== WHAT IS IT?
A simple means of using a bookmark to add your javascript to an external page.
Think of your Del.ico.us bookmarking tool - it can be used to save information
to your site from any other site out there

=== HOW IT WORKS
The bookmark part simply 'injects' a .js file into the page, by adding it to
the HEAD element. Your users will put it in their toolbar, and click on it when
they want to use it.

=== WHAT CAN IT DO?
Anything you want! You can parse the page DOM with HPRICOT or some other tool,
or you can just save the URL. It's entirely up to you! This is very similar to
how THISNEXT toolbar works, at least the beginning part!

=== SAMPLE
Coming soon!

=== NOTES
I am building a very basic example of the tool. It can be used for much more
powerful things! You will notice that the URL of the script is a directory,
not a filename. This resolves some cross browser issues. For PHP, just make
a file called index.php and put it in that particular directory. For Rails,
create a controller method that renders the file like this:
render :file => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/adder.js"

=== THE BOOKMARK
The bookmark itself is simply a javascript href. Here is an example that's
broken up and commented for easy reading. (NOTE spaces MUST be replaced with %20)

javascript:(            #just like any other javascript href
function() {            #start the function call

var x=document.getElementsByTagName('head').item(0);  #Grab HEAD element
var so=document.createElement('script');              #Create SCRIPT element

var s='http://www.yoursite.com/adder/';             #URL for the JS file
if(typeof so !='object')                            #Make sure you can add it
    so=document.standardCreateElement('script');    #Create script element
    so.setAttribute('src',s);                       #Set src to your site
    so.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');      #Set proper type
    x.appendChild(so);                              #Append it to the HEAD
}
)();                                                #Execute the function

and the whole shebang uninterrupted
javascript:(function()%20{var%20x=document.getElementsByTagName('head').item(0);var%20so=document.createElement('script');var%20s='http://www.yoursite.com/adder/';if(typeof%20so%20!='object')%20so=document.standardCreateElement('script');so.setAttribute('src',s);so.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');x.appendChild(so);})();
